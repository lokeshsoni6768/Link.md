Title - World-Data-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning

Discription - This project, developed by Manohar, Deepak, Keerthana, and Lokesh, aims to explore and analyze world data using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on understanding global trends and patterns through various machine learning models, including regression and classification.

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project was to analyze world data by leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify trends, make predictions, and uncover meaningful insights. We used large datasets containing global indicators such as population, GDP, health data, and environmental statistics to apply regression and classification models.

Project Overview:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We began by cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Through EDA, we visualized and summarized the key patterns in the data, identifying important correlations and outliers.

Machine Learning Models:

- Regression: We applied regression models to predict numerical outcomes, such as forecasting GDP or population growth based on historical data.
  
- Classification: Classification models were used to categorize countries based on their economic development, health indicators, or environmental sustainability.
  
- Model Evaluation:
We evaluated our models using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and root mean square error (RMSE). This helped us assess how well our models performed and where improvements could be made.

- Presentation of Results:
Two PPTs were created to summarize the key findings and the methodology behind our analysis, which can be useful for presenting the results to stakeholders or other interested parties.
